# Esophageal Cancer in Kenya - Data Exploration & Visualization

## 📌 Project Overview
This project explores **Esophageal Cancer** cases in Kenya using **SQL for data analysis** and **Python for visualization**. The dataset is a **mock dataset** designed to analyze trends in patient demographics, cancer stages, treatment outcomes, and risk factors.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **SQL (PostgreSQL)**: Data cleaning, exploration, and summarization.
- **Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn)**: Data visualization.
- **pgAdmin4**: Running SQL queries and exporting data.


## 🏥 Dataset Information
The dataset contains information on:
- **Patients** (ID, name, age, gender, region, diagnosis date)
- **Cancer Stages** (stage, diagnosis method, diagnosis date)
- **Treatments** (treatment type, start & end date, outcome)
- **Risk Factors** (smoking status, alcohol use, dietary habits)
- **Hospital Visits** (hospital name, admission & discharge dates)

## 🔍 SQL Analysis Performed
- **Patient distribution by cancer stage**
- **Average age of patients per stage**
- **Most common diagnosis methods**
- **Treatment outcomes by cancer stage**

## 📊 Visualizations (Python)
- **Bar Chart**: Number of patients by cancer stage
